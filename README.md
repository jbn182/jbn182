### Hi there 👋 I'm Benjamin
I am 22 years old and I am from Argentina. At the age of 7, my parents showed me the beauty of programming, and since that day I have loved creating tools with the power of programming to help people.

Right now I specialize in web development with Nuxt.js but I know other technologies such as: Electron.js · Solidity · Puppeteer (Node.js) · Vue.js · JavaScript · GunDb · MongoDB · MySQL · PHP

I developed a lot of time with elixir and its framework for web development phoenix

I am also passionate about developing decentralized systems so I ended up learning technologies like: GunDb, IPFS and solidity

I speak: English, Spanish, Portuguese and Russian
